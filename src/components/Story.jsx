            TEO was originally founded by the late{" "}
            <strong>Eng. Mohamed Abdel Mohaimen</strong>, a visionary who
            reshaped Egypt's construction landscape in the early 1980s. With a
            commitment to architectural excellence, precision finishing, and
            client-centric service, he sought to elevate the built environment
            and introduce a new standard of design sophistication.
          </p>

          <p>
            As one of the pioneers in bridging the public and private sectors,
            Eng. Mohamed championed the idea that architecture should not only
            serve functional needs but also enhance the cultural and aesthetic
            identity of communities.
